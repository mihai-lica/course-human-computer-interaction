# Human-Computer Interaction course presentation support

## This is a TeX version of the Human-Computer Interaction slide decks by Professor Saul Greenberg from the University of Calgary, based on the license written in the first slide of each of his slide decks: "Permission is granted to use this for non-commercial purposes as long as general credit to Saul Greenberg is clearly maintained." The new slides that I have added to the original presentations are marked with a star.

## Credit to: The students whose names can be found in the TeX sources and have made the translation to TeX.
